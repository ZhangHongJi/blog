<h1>Combine some commits of GIT in one Git合并多条提交记录</h1>

<h2>show commit count 显示提交记录数</h2>

<pre data-language="Shell">
git rev-list HEAD --count
</pre>

<h2>combine commit or modify commit message 合并或修改记录</h2>

<ul>
<li>command 命令</li>
</ul>

<pre data-language="Shell">
git rebase -i HEAD~$x
</pre>

<p>其中$x代表你期望操作的记录数，小于提交记录数
$x is the count of commit that you want to combine or change,
$x is less than commit count</p>

<p>如 e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>你想操作最后十条，则$x为10 
  if you want to change the last ten commits, the value of $x is 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre data-language="Shell">
pick 123456 init
pick 7890ab add text
pick cdef12 modify text
pick 345678 modify text

# Rebase abcdef..345678 onto abcdef
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
</pre>

<ul>
<li>edit 编辑</li>
</ul>

<p>change the "pick" that is in front of the commit line to "s",
the commit will combine to previous commit.
在你期望合并的commit将前面的pick更改成s就行，
此条commit将于上一条commit合并</p>

<p>change the "pick to "r", the commit message will be modify.
pick改成r表示修改当前提交信息</p>

<p>e.g.例如：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"pick 345678 modify text" --> "s 345678 modify text"</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>change commit message after saving 保存后，重新编写提交信息</li>
</ul>
